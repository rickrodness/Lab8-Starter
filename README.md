## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers
Graceful degradation means designing apps to work on newer systems but still function on older ones. Service workers help with this by making web apps work offline. They save important files on the user's device, so the app can still run even without internet. This makes apps more reliable and user-friendly, no matter the network conditions.
